## üöÄ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CareCase.git
cd CareCase
```

### Backend Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv backend-env
source backend-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-backend.txt
```

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn server.main:app --reload
```

---

### Frontend (Desktop App) Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv frontend-env
source frontend-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-frontend.txt
```

Launch the UI app:

```bash
python client/app.py
```

---

### Vision & Expression Tools Setup (FER, Gaze Tracking)

```bash
python3 -m venv fer-env
source fer-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-fer.txt
```

Then enables you to run the gaze tracking or face/expression monitoring tools as needed.

## üì¶ Notes

- **MongoDB credentials** are required in a `.env` file.
    
- **OpenAI API key** is needed if running online mode for dynamic content generation.
    
- Designed to **fallback** using local models if API keys are missing.
